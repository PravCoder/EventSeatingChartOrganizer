This repositary is our solution to the project 2 prompt for Engineering Thinking.

Prompt: At the start of each semester, Dr. Pittenger hosts a Womenâ€™s Welcome
Dinner for the Women in Engineering (WiE) program. This event hosts
about 140 guests. Most guests pre-register for the event where they
provide information on if they are faculty, staff, student, or a WiE student
mentor as well as their engineering major and if they are bringing a
guest. Currently, Dr. Pittenger uses this information to create a seating
chart ahead of the event that attempts to strategically match tablemates
based upon commonalities while also trying to distribute the
faculty/staff. The problem is that there are often additional guests that
arrive without registering as well as guests who do not show. When this
happens, Dr. Pittenger is left trying to scramble to rearrange things
instead of enjoying the event. She needs a solution that allows her to
update the seating chart in real time to make sure all attendees have a
quality experience.
